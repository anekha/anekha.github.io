As part of the **Le Wagon Bootcamp**, this was my final group project:

> 🧠 **Proven Hypothesis**  
> *The academic performance of a student depends not only on their academic capabilities but also their socio-economic status.*

### 🏫 Imagine this...

You're a headteacher managing a school of thousands of students. How do you create an ideal environment where every student can thrive?

## 🎯 Project Goal

To build a **machine learning model** that forecasts academic outcomes using a dataset of Portuguese students.  
The objective was to uncover **socio-economic drivers** influencing final grades (G3) and offer a predictive dashboard for education leaders.

## 🔍 Data Exploration

We started with a raw dataset and trimmed irrelevant or misleading variables like:

- Home address
- Parent jobs (too many "other" values)
- Nursery attendance
- G1/G2 (used G3 only as target)

We then grouped related features:
- Alcohol intake (weekday/weekend)
- Family dynamics
- Time management
- Educational support
- Reason for school choice
- Parental education

Tools used:
- **Heatmaps**
- **Boxplots**
- **Group binning**
- **Value counts**
- **Correlation analysis**

## ⚙️ Model Training

After feature engineering and encoding:
- Split data into train/test sets
- Used **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
- Preprocessing: scaling + one-hot encoding

We tested multiple models for comparison:

| Model                     | Precision | Test vs Train | Overfitting |
|--------------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Logistic Regression      | 0.75      | 0.72 vs 0.72  | ❌          |
| KNN                      | 0.76      | 0.67 vs 0.83  | ✅          |
| Random Forest            | 0.81      | 0.70 vs 0.98  | ✅          |
| XGBoost                  | 0.82      | 0.68 vs 0.95  | ✅          |
| **Gradient Boosting**    | **0.76**  | **0.70 vs 0.78** | ✅ Slight |

## 🧪 Final Metrics (on test data)

- 🎯 **Accuracy**: `0.96`
- 📊 **Precision**: `0.95`
- 🔍 **Recall**: `0.99`
- 🧮 **F1 Score**: `0.97`

These metrics show strong performance on the binary classification task: predicting whether a student would pass or fail based on inputs.

## 🎓 Insights

- Students who had failed before are more likely to receive support and improve.
- Mother's education had stronger correlation than father's.
- Study time and school choice were significant drivers.
- Most students want higher education, causing class imbalance.
