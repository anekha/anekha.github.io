_This is Part 2 of a two-part series on crater detection using deep learning. [Missed Part 1? Catch up here →](https://anekha.github.io/deep-learning/2025/03/28/NASA.html)_

## 🚀 Overview

In Part 1, we built a **YOLOv10 + Ellipse R-CNN** pipeline to detect and localize lunar craters.

This post focuses on:
- 🌀 Rim-fitting using Ellipse R-CNN  
- 📊 Evaluation metrics and precision challenges  
- ⚙️ System integration and resource constraints  
- 🔍 Final takeaways and next steps

## 🧠 From Boxes to Rims: LunarLens Pipeline

Our two-stage detection system — **LunarLens** — works like this:

1. **YOLOv10** detects crater bounding boxes quickly.  
2. **Ellipse R-CNN** then fits an ellipse to the rim of each crater.

This hybrid system balances speed with shape accuracy, ideal for autonomous space navigation.

## 🌀 Postprocessing with Ellipse R-CNN

Bounding boxes from YOLOv10 are cropped and passed to Ellipse R-CNN, which predicts:

- (x, y) center  
- Major & minor axes  
- Orientation  

This gives us a mathematically accurate rim outline.

```text
Crater 1: (100.3, 40.8), (101.5, 39.6), ...
Crater 2: (463.2, 80.9), (462.3, 81.4), ...
```

## 📊 Evaluation & Metrics

We assessed detection quality at **IoU thresholds of 50% and 70%**, using AP, precision, and recall.

| Metric    | IoU = 50 | IoU = 70 |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| AP        | 0.111    | 0.003    |
| Recall    | 0.145    | 0.010    |
| Precision | 0.337    | 0.042    |

🧠 **Key takeaway**: Precision drops sharply at high IoU — highlighting how tight rim localization is the hard part, not detection.

## 🧪 System Performance Under Constraints

We were tasked with running this system on **CPU-only hardware** with Raspberry Pi–level specs.

| Constraint   | Result           |
|--------------|------------------|
| Image Size   | 5 MP             |
| Runtime      | ~20 sec / image  |
| RAM          | < 4 GB           |
| Hardware     | No GPU           |

## 🔍 Final Thoughts & Next Steps

- ✅ **YOLOv10** was great for rapid detection, but rim precision required postprocessing.  
- ✅ **Ellipse R-CNN** helped convert detections into usable geometric inputs.  
- ⚠️ Evaluation at high IoU exposed the need for better shape-fit training.

**Next steps:**
- Fine-tune Ellipse R-CNN on lunar tile crops  
- Apply weighted evaluation based on crater size  
- Improve YOLO thresholding and ensemble strategies
