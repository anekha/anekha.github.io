## About Me ☁️ 

<!-- Hi, I’m Anekha — currently completing my Master’s in Data Science at [**Rice University**](https://csweb.rice.edu/academics/graduate-programs/professional-master-data-science) in Houston, Texas, where I specialize in **Computer Vision** through the [**Fulbright Elsevier UK-US Scholarship**](https://fulbright.org.uk/people-search/anekha-sokhal/).   -->

<!-- I'm developing an **object detection deep learning model** in collaboration with [**NASA**](https://www.nasa.gov/johnson/), and conducting **3D reconstruction research** in partnership with [**Stability AI**](https://stability.ai) as part of the [**Computer Vision Research Lab at Rice**](https://vision.rice.edu/).  -->

> **AI engineer. [Fulbright Scholar](https://fulbright.org.uk/people-search/anekha-sokhal/). Ex-JP Morgan trader.**  
> I build real-world AI — from [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/johnson/) crater detection to generative 3D startups.
{: .notice--success}

I led NASA’s crater detection research (93% precision for spacecraft navigation), am advancing 3D reconstruction research in collaboration with [Stability AI](https://stability.ai) at Rice University, and founded [JewelVision](https://jewelvision.ai/) — reimagining how 3D products are created for immersive experiences like virtual try-on.

My career’s always been anchored in data — from modeling financial risk as a derivatives trader at JP Morgan to training deep learning systems for multimodal AI. I bring a unique mix of technical depth, product strategy, and **cross-industry experience** — spanning finance, aerospace, and e-commerce.

🎤 Regular speaker in the US AI scene.  
🛠️I’m especially interested in building **multimodal systems that enhance human-AI collaboration** — tools that are both technically rigorous and socially meaningful.

  <h2>My Story ✨</h2>

  <p>My journey into tech hasn’t been linear. I graduated with a degree in <strong><a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/bsc-morse/">MORSE (Mathematics, Operational Research, Statistics, and Economics)</a></strong> from the <strong>University of Warwick</strong> in 2014 — basically data science before it had a name! My first job out of university was at <strong><a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/markets">JP Morgan</a></strong> as a <strong>Derivatives Trader</strong>, which had been my dream job — and where I spent the next 7 years.</p>

  <p>During the pandemic, I found myself helping my family’s business and fell in love with using <strong>data analytics for business transformation</strong>. That experience — and a pro bono consulting project with the <strong><a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/impact/volunteerism">Maharishi Institute</a></strong> (the world’s first self-funded university) — opened my eyes to the power of data beyond the trading floor.</p>

  <p>Helping them made me realize how much customer-focused consumer businesses lacked data-driven decision making — a huge contrast to the energy markets I came from, where every move was backed by data. 💡</p>

  <p>I joined the <strong><a href="https://www.lewagon.com/data-science-course">Le Wagon bootcamp</a></strong> to build a strong foundation in data science and reignite my Python programming. Wanting to make a real difference using data, I felt driven to understand <em>what to build</em> — which led me to being awarded a <strong>Fulbright Scholarship</strong>, and eventually to Rice, where I founded <strong><a href="https://www.jewelvision.ai/">JewelVision</a></strong> — a startup building <strong>3D assets and virtual try-on experiences</strong> using computer vision and generative AI for e-commerce brands. 💍✨</p>

## What I'm Into Now 🚀

My research focuses on **multi-view 3D reconstruction**, **generative models**, and **multimodal AI applications**. I'm also exploring new areas of computer vision that excite me every day.

I’ve led projects with cross-functional teams, built technical prototypes, pitched to investors, and spoken at AI events. I’m passionate about applying cutting-edge research to real-world creative industries — especially fashion, jewelry, and design — and using **data to drive better decisions**.

## Outside of AI 🧘🏽‍♀️

I love traveling, hiking, skiing, and spending time with friends, family, and animals. Life is more fun when it’s a mix of creativity, nature, and purpose.

Thanks for stopping by! 😊
